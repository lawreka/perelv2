		<div class="text">Pain Threshold takes its name from the measurement of pain the doctor uses to test the patient. In Perel’s work, this term involves more than the threshold of  physical pain. Engaging in questions of openness, vulnerability, control, consent, care, and intimacy, Pain Threshold invites the audience to bear witness to their own emotional and intellectual thresholds.<br><br>
		Perel’s research for this work began in the midst of receiving care in preparation for another performance. It was inside of this experience that the artist asked, “What if this care was the performance?” From there, Perel grew curious about the format of Talk Shows, and began to re-watch episodes of Oprah, Barbara Walters’ interviews, and Late-Night shows. Perel decided that the position of receptivity to care would make them the perfect Talk Show host. As Perel opens up their body, an audience member might be willing to open up emotionally. So, if you imagine a disabled, queer Barbara Walters, you’ll get the picture…<br><br>
		As this part of the project was in development, two important events occurred. The first event was the artist’s discovery of sex therapist, Esther Perel. Not only do they bear the same last name, but they both use discursive practices in their work to frame life events. The second occurrence was the the hearing of United States Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. As Perel listened to the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the artist was reminded of a sexual trauma experienced years ago. The parallels between Ford’s story and Perel’s were undeniable. Perel then decided to open up the past and reveal this pain endured long ago.<br><br>
		The culminating message of this performance is that in that in the admission of vulnerability lies true strength, and that power rests in the hands of those who dare to challenge the status quo to imagine a higher form of justice than what is presently available.<br><br>
