		<div class="text">Pain Threshold takes its name from the measurement of pain the doctor uses to test the patient. In Perel’s work, this term involves more than the threshold of  physical pain. Engaging in questions of openness, vulnerability, control, consent, care, and intimacy, Pain Threshold invites the audience to bear witness to their own emotional and intellectual thresholds.<br><br>
		Perel’s research for this work began in the midst of receiving care in preparation for another performance. It was inside of this experience that the artist asked, “What if this care was the performance?” From there, Perel grew curious about the format of Talk Shows, and began to re-watch episodes of Oprah, Barbara Walters’ interviews, and Late-Night shows. Perel decided that the position of receptivity to care would make them the perfect Talk Show host. As Perel opens up their body, an audience member might be willing to open up emotionally. So, if you imagine a disabled, queer Barbara Walters, you’ll get the picture…<br><br>
		As this part of the project was in development, two important events occurred. The first event was the artist’s discovery of sex therapist, Esther Perel. Not only do they bear the same last name, but they both use discursive practices in their work to frame life events. The second occurrence was the the hearing of United States Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. As Perel listened to the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the artist was reminded of a sexual trauma experienced years ago. The parallels between Ford’s story and Perel’s were undeniable. Perel then decided to open up the past and reveal this pain endured long ago.<br><br>
		The culminating message of this performance is that in that in the admission of vulnerability lies true strength, and that power rests in the hands of those who dare to challenge the status quo to imagine a higher form of justice than what is presently available.<br><br>

			<h1>More Than Just A Piece of Sky</h1>
			More Than Just a Piece of Sky

Premiered at The Chocolate Factory Theater, September 17-20, 2014. Presented as part of the Queer New York International Arts Festival.

Duration: 50 minutes

Choreographed, Written and Performed by Marissa Perel with Lindsay Reuter and Jumatatu Poe. Composers: Jon Moniaci and Shawn Hansen. Cover of Bronski Beat’s Smalltown Boy by Miguel Gutierrez. Video: Nicholas Steindorf. Video interview editor: Kristiana Weseloh. Production Stage Manager: Lillie De. Lighting design: Elliott Jenetopulos. Costume design: Stephen May. Bed design: John Taylor.

More Than Just a Piece of Sky is a multidisciplinary performance that mines personal and cultural exile as a site for the exploration of gender and sexuality, knowledge and power, and ability and disability. My physical restriction to the bed gives way to a type of dream-space, as the bedroom becomes a Yeshiva, where Yentl (performed by Reuter) and Avi (performed by Poe), come to study. Video interviews, episodic dances and poetic monologues shape a world where we uncover our own definitions of identity and intimacy against our childhood belief systems, as we seek to create new ways of seeing the self/other.

After the “cut-up” method of William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin, we performed live cut-ups, reading from a selection of texts in my personal library that span authors such as Kathy Acker, Susan Sontag, Alison Kafer, Samuel R. Delany, Camille Roy, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, José Muñoz, Frantz Fanon, Judith Butler, Diane Chisolm, and David Wojnarowicz. We created a “third space” with the juxtaposition and interruption of our readings, speaking to the legibility of the body, pain, desire, and violence. Dances emerge from our readings, accessing a form of presence that lies between the subjectivities of the performers and their projected characters. Miguel Gutierrez’s cover of the 1980’s gay anthem, Smalltown Boy, a scratched LP of the original soundtrack of Yentl on a Fisher-Price record player, and the drone of my sruti box propel the dance.

Yentl, Lesson 3 performed at Incubator Arts Project, and Yentl Lesson 4 performed at Secret Works Loft, July 2012

The Yentl Series  is based on Isaac Bashevis Singer’s story, Yentl The Yeshiva Boy, which was turned into the 1983 movie musical, Yentl, directed by and starring Barbra Streisand. I re-wrote the story to create a more open, direct discussion of feminism, queer desire and spirituality. The performance is driven by monologue and song. I use the soundtrack to Yentl, Rachmaninoff’s Concertos 2 & 3, pop and Klezmer to set the scene for minimal, durational movement. For some performances I have worn tallit (shawl) and tefilin (bindings), a strap-on, and a neon pink cast of a chicken. The text, song, dance and objects tell the story of oppressive religious beliefs, the power dynamics of gender, abuse and sexual transformation.
			<h1>Night Ballast</h1>
			Night Ballast

Performance for the “Food For Thought”  series at Danspace Project, St. Mark’s Church-In-The-Bowery
Curated by Stacy Szymaszek
2013

This performance was based on a letter I wrote to Stacy Szymaszek about living with chronic pain, memories of the poet, Akilah Oliver, quotations from the book, The Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability and the film, Querelle by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Accompanying my reading of the text is a choreographed dance made in collaboration with Justin Cabrillos and Tess Dworman, who perform with a staff made by artist, Matthew Shalzi. The song, “Boston Street Lullaby No.2”  by Chris Forsyth is also featured. Thom Donovan provided poetic dramaturgy for the composition of the text.

			<h1>Boy Blue</h1>
			Boy Blue

Performance as part of the group exhibition, The Magic Flute
Featuring work by Elijah Burgher, Joe Fyfe, Andrew Holmquist, William J. O’Brien. Tal R., Kimber Smith, Patricia Treib
Curated by Jacob Meehan
Golden Gallery, NY
2012

This group exhibition’s title is derived from the Kimber Smith painting, The Magic Flute. The title of an opera by Mozart, it is a singspiel-a format that includes both singing and spoken word. In it the main character, a prince named Tamino, is sent on a journey to save his wife-to-be, which ultimately requires him to pass a number of trials ensued by a council of priests. A flute given to Tamino aids and protects, allowing him to “change men’s hearts.”

Embodying the prince Tamino from Mozart’s The Magic Flute, I created a  contemporary singspiel with original and borrowed music, dance, and poetry. Re-shaping the gallery into a landscape with tape, fabric, a record player, microphone and shruti box, I mapped out discreet zones for performance within the exhibition. Paying tribute to Kimber Smith, who was known to have dressed in all blue, and borrowing from the song, “Boy Blue” from Cyndi Lauper’s True Colors album, I channeled the figure of the artist for a durational performance that was part gonzo art history lesson, dance class, group therapy and séance.

		For a long time, all I could do was surrender.

Performance, video and installation. Screening at the Gene Siskel Film Center as part of The Great Refusal: Videos Taking On New Queer Aesthetics (Chicago 2012), performance and installation at Little Berlin (Philadelphia 2011), performance and exhibition at Spoke Gallery (Chicago 2011), performance and screening at Outerspace Studio (Chicago 2011).

This work, made in collaboration with Oliverio Rodriguez, explores the edge between provocation and exposure through text and action. We participated in an exchange of writing on personal losses (death, rape, gender mis-identification), erotic fantasies, and responses to watching films in the New French Extremity genre (Ma Mere, 29 Palms, The Piano Teacher, etc.).

Through the combination of writing and observing these films, we created a system of actions that we describe as performative submission. We used the language of BDSM as the direction for task-based action, endurance and dance. We took turns topping one another in our actions and physically pushed one another into submission in front of the audience. In this sense, the audience played the roles of both voyeur and participant.

				April 30-May 22, 2010<br><br>
				wet works is a Workout Girl installation where I re-construct my studio in the gallery with painting, text, video, sections cut from my studio walls, and materials that together serve as a set for live performance.<br><br>
				Gathering the clothes and objects that comprise the installation, I mirrored myself performing on the video monitors, covered my body with vaseline, powder and glitter and played with a little girl’s comb, fake white bird, “Dad” memorial wreath, faux fur rug and shiny pillow.<br><br>
				The performance-installation became a camp-queer-punk ritual for self-healing where my writing about the deranged power dynamics of sexual abuse and being a ballerina in the 80’s formed a palimpsest-collage with love song lyrics by pop stars of that era.<br><br>
			<h1>Workout Girl</h1>
			Script featured in the group exhibition, “otherwise” at Beige gallery (Memphis, TN 2013), solo video screening at Co-Worker Projects (NY 2012), performed at Links Hall (Chicago 2010), Co-Prosperity Sphere (Chicago 2010), D.I.V.O Institute (Prague, C.R. 2010), and Chicago Cultural Center (2009).<br><br>
			Workout Girl is a persona that channels 1980’s pop culture and girlhood to address issues of self-image, celebrity, sex appeal, and abuse. It began as a studio experiment with glitter, vaseline, baby powder, and hosiery and evolved into a solo performance. Each iteration of Workout Girl is unique and involves a selection of 1980’s pop hits, talking with the audience, and improvised dance. Sometimes it involves sex-play with roast chicken and lots of paint.<br><br>
			<h1>Shared body</h1>
			shared body

This is a 3 hour durational performance-installation commissioned by the Department of Cultural Affairs at the Chicago Cultural Center for the Site Unseen Exhibition themed “disabling conditions.” I choreographed the piece based on writing from my journals after recovery from a near debilitating accident. I performed the piece with dancers, Adam Rose and Georgia Wall. The installation by Madeleine Bailey consists of sculptures that truncate limbs, rendering the performers’ bodies inaccessible. Included in the installation is my bed, a repository of memories of intimacy and aide in dark times.
